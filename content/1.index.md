# Background

The use of machine learning techniques in the financial industry is steadily evolving. Today, machine learning (ML) is used for everything from risk assessment to trading decisions. It has changed how the financial services industry operates and manages data.
In line with the needs of the development of financial technology and with the purpose of using advanced technology to provide better services, the company combines AI technology applications with traditional finance to achieve more efficient and accurate data analysis.

## How is machine learning used in finance?

Machine learning systems help people understand massive volumes of data and uncover important patterns within them. This information is then used to enhance business processes, make informed decisions, and assist with prediction tasks.

Machine learning in Finance could offer:

1. Better pricing
2. Mitigate risks caused by human error
3. Automate repetitive tasks 
4. Understand customer behavior

### Pages

Create your Markdown pages in the `content/` directory:

```md [content/index.md]
# My title

This first paragraph will be treated as the page meta description.
```

You can overwrite meta tags by using front-matter:

```md [content/index.md]
---
title: 'Custom title'
description: 'Custom meta description'
image: 'Custom image injected as `og:image`'
---

# My title

This first paragraph will be treated as the page meta description.
```

This is done thanks to Nuxt Content's [document-driven mode](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/document-driven) of Nuxt Content.

### Navigation

The navigation is generated from your pages, you can take a look at the [`<AppNavbar>`](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind/blob/main/components/AppNavbar.vue) component to see how it works.

It uses the [Navigation](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/navigation)  from Nuxt Content to fetch the navigation object.

To customize the title displayed in the navigation, you can set the `navigation.title` property in the front-matter of your pages:

```md
---
navigation.title: 'Home'
---

# Welcome to my site

With a beautiful description
```

### Theme configuration

You can configure Content Wind global configuration in the `app.config.ts` file:

```ts [signature]
interface AppConfigInput {
  cover?: string, // default: '/cover.jpg'
  socials?: {
    twitter?: string
    github?: string
    mastodon?: string
  }
}
```

Example of settings Twitter and GitHub icons in the navbar:

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  socials: {
    twitter: 'Atinux',
    github: 'Atinux/content-wind'
    mastodon: '@atinux@webtoo.ls'
  }
})
```

### Icons

Use any icon from [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org) with the `<Icon>` component:

```html
<Icon name="ph:music-notes-fill" />
```

You can also use it in your Markdown:

```md
:icon{name="ph:music-notes-fill"}
```

Will result in :icon{name="ph:music-notes-fill"}

### Code Highlight

It supports code highlighting with Shiki and as well as different [VS Code themes](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md#all-themes).

::markdown-block
\```ts
export default () => 'Hello Content Wind'
\```
::

```

Updating the theme is as simple as editing your `nuxt.config`:

import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    highlight: {
      theme: 'one-dark-pro',
    }
  }
})
```
